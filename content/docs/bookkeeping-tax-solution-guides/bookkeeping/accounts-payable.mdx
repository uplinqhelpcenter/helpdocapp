## Accounts Payable Support â€“ Uplinq Solution Guide  
*Level 1 (Recordâ€‘Only) Service*

---

### Atâ€‘aâ€‘Glance  
| | **What We Do** | **What We Don't Do** |
|---|---|---|
| **Bill Capture** | Import, review, and code vendor bills into your accounting ledger (QBO/Xero). | Pay vendors, schedule payments, or initiate ACH/checks. |
| **Coding** | Apply GL accounts (and optional Class/Location/Job *if preâ€‘mapped*). | Create new GL accounts, design complex approval workflows, or split invoices across >2 dimensions without a surcharge. |
| **Quality Control** | Flag duplicates, missing data, or unreadable scans in a weekly "Exceptions List." | Chase vendors or your staff for missing documents. |
| **Retention** | Attach each processed bill PDF to the ledger entry; store on your cloud drive for 7 years. | Act as your longâ€‘term document management system (>7 years) unless you upgrade storage. |
| **Reporting** | Provide a weekly CSV of bills entered and monthâ€‘end AP Aging summary. | Produce custom KPI dashboards or analytics (available separately). |

---

### Service Flavors  
| **Name** | **Who Provides the Bills?** | **Typical Fit** |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **AP Lite â€“ Client Dropâ€‘Off** | You drop every invoice into a single folder/inbox by **Wednesday 12 p.m.** | Most SMBs that already receive bills via email or Dext. |
| **AP Lite â€“ Portal Pull** | Uplinq downloads invoices from a designated portal / shared drive you grant access to. | SaaS companies, utilities, or landlords with vendor portals. *(+Fetch Fee applies)* |

> **Important:** Both flavors are strictly *recordâ€‘only*. If you ever need us to *schedule* or *release* payments, talk to Sales about **AP Level 2**.

2. **Folder/Inâ€‘App Inbox** â€“ single drop point (no hunting across 10 emails).  
3. **Accounting Access** â€“ Accountant user in QBO/Xero.  
4. **Credential Handoff** â€“ if we're fetching bills, MFA arrangements upfront.  
5. **Timely Responses** â€“ questions flagged in the exceptions sheet must be answered before the next cycle.

### Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: What happens if we miss the Wednesday deadline?**  
 A: Invoices roll into next week's batch. If you need sameâ€‘week processing, that's an *Exception Rush* billed at \$10 per invoice.

**Q: Can you split a single bill across multiple jobs?**  
 A: Yesâ€”up to two dimensions (e.g., GL + Job). More than that triggers the Complexity Surcharge or requires upgrading service level.

**Q: Do you verify vendor bank details?**  
 A: Not in Level 1. We record invoices only. Vendor onboarding validations are part of Level 3 and higher.

**Q: How secure is my data?**  
 A: All files are stored in SOC 2â€‘audited cloud storage with roleâ€‘based access. MFA is enforced on every credential we hold.

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**  
 A: Absolutely. Your CSM can step you up to Level 2+ for payment scheduling or full payment execution whenever you're ready.
