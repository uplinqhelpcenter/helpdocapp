# Quick Start Guide: Preparing for Your Onboarding Meeting

<Callout type="info" title="Prepare for a Smooth Start">
Congratulations on taking the first step with Uplinq! Properly preparing for your onboarding meeting is key to a successful partnership and ensures we can start delivering accurate bookkeeping reports quickly.
</Callout>

This guide outlines what to expect during your onboarding meeting and what you'll need to have ready for an efficient setup session.

## Why Prepare?

Your onboarding meeting sets the foundation for accurate and timely bookkeeping. During this crucial session, your Uplinq specialist will work with you to:

-   Establish your bookkeeping setup clearly and accurately.
-   Securely connect your necessary financial accounts and integrations.
-   Review your business structure and financial needs (including tax information or extension needs).
-   Identify any immediate actions required to get your bookkeeping started promptly.

Starting with the right setup and data saves time, reduces errors, and helps ensure your long-term financial success with Uplinq.

## What to Have Ready

To ensure your onboarding meeting is productive and efficient, please gather the following items beforehand:

-   **Last Filed Tax Returns:** Your most recent business tax returns (and personal, if relevant to setup).
-   **Opening Bank Statements:** Statements for all business bank/credit accounts covering the month your Uplinq bookkeeping service begins.
-   **Financial Account Credentials:** Secure access (username/password) for all online banking and credit card portals you intend to link via Plaid.
    <Callout type="warn" title="Security Note">
    You will enter credentials directly into the secure Plaid module during the meeting. Uplinq specialists will **never** ask for or see your passwords.
    </Callout>
-   **QuickBooks Online (QBO) and Third-Party App Credentials:** Login details for your QuickBooks Online account (if applicable) and any other financial apps we need to connect.
-   **Payment Information:** Be ready to provide payment details to set up your Uplinq subscription billing via Stripe during the call (screen sharing will typically be paused for this step).

## What to Expect During the Meeting

Your dedicated Uplinq onboarding specialist will guide you through:

-   Securely connecting your bank accounts, credit cards, and relevant third-party apps using tools like Plaid.
-   Confirming critical business information and details relevant to your specific bookkeeping and tax needs.
-   Reviewing the initial Uplinq platform setup and addressing any immediate questions.
-   Clearly outlining the next steps and any immediate follow-up tasks assigned to you.

## After the Meeting: Check Your Tasks

Immediately following your onboarding, please check the **Data Hub** section within your Uplinq app. You may find urgent tasks requiring your action, such as:

-   **Connecting specific accounts** that couldn't be linked during the call.
    ```text title="Example Task"
    Connect your Chase 2232 account.
    ```
-   **Uploading necessary documents** like prior tax returns or bank statements.
    ```text title="Example Task"
    Upload your 2022 Form 1120S tax return.
    ```

<Callout type="info">
Completing these initial tasks promptly is crucial for activating your bookkeeping services and ensuring timely delivery of your financial reports.
