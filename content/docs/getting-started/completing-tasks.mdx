Uplinq's AI handles much of your bookkeeping automatically, but occasionally you'll need to complete tasks to keep your financial records accurate and up-to-date. This guide explains how to manage and complete those tasks efficiently.

## Understanding Your Task Dashboard

Your task dashboard organizes all the actions that require your attention:

1. Log in to your Uplinq account
2. Navigate to the **Tasks** section on your dashboard
3. View tasks sorted by priority and due date
4. Click on any task to see details and take action
