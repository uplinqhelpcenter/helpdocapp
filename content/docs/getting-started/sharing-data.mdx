# Sharing Data with Uplinq

To get the most from Uplinq's AI-powered bookkeeping, you'll need to share your financial data securely. This guide covers all the ways you can connect accounts and upload documents.

## Connecting Bank Accounts

Uplinq uses Plaid, a secure financial connection service, to link your bank accounts:

1. From your Uplinq dashboard, go to **Connections** > **Add Financial Account**
2. Select your bank from the list or search by name
3. Log in with your bank credentials (these are never stored by Uplinq)
4. Select the accounts you want to connect
5. Authorize the connection

Uplinq uses bank-level encryption and security protocols. We can only read your transaction data and never have access to move money or make changes to your accounts.
