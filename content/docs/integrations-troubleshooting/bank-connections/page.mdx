### Disconnected Accounts

If your bank account shows as "Disconnected" or "Connection Error":

1. **Navigate to Connected Accounts**
   - Log in to your Uplinq dashboard
   - Go to Settings → Connected Accounts

2. **Reconnect the Account**
   - Find the disconnected account
   - Click "Reconnect" next to the account name
   - Follow the prompts to update your credentials

3. **Verify Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Ensure your bank's MFA settings are up-to-date
   - Have your phone or authentication app ready

### Missing or Delayed Transactions

If transactions aren't appearing or are delayed:

1. **Check Transaction Timeframe**
   - Recent transactions may take 24-48 hours to appear
   - Verify the transaction has cleared (not pending) at your bank

2. **Manually Refresh Connection**
   - Go to Settings → Connected Accounts
   - Select the account with missing transactions
   - Click "Refresh Connection" or "Sync Now"

3. **Review Transaction Filters**
   - Check if any transaction filters are active
   - Adjust date ranges if necessary

## Bank-Specific Troubleshooting

### Chase Bank

- **Security Updates:** Chase frequently updates security measures. You may need to log in to your Chase account directly and approve the connection.
- **MFA Issues:** Ensure your phone number is up-to-date in your Chase profile for verification codes.

### Bank of America

- **Session Timeouts:** Bank of America connections may time out frequently. Try reconnecting during non-peak hours.
- **Browser Cookies:** Clear browser cookies if using the web app, or restart the mobile app before reconnecting.

### Wells Fargo

- **Security Questions:** Have your security question answers ready when reconnecting.
- **Account Access:** Ensure your online banking access hasn't been restricted due to multiple failed login attempts.
